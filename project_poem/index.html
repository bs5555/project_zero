    <p>Dante Alighieri</p>
    <h1>Divine Comedy</h1>
    <h2>Inferno</h2>
    <h3>Canto I</h3>
    <p>When I had journeyed half of our life’s way,<br>
  I found myself within a shadowed forest,<br>
  for I had lost the path that does not stray.</p>

<p>Ah, it is hard to speak of what it was,<br>
  that savage forest, dense and difficult,<br>
  which even in recall renews my fear:</p>

  <p>so bitter — death is hardly more severe!<br>
  But to retell the good discovered there,<br>
  I’ll also tell the other things I saw.</p>

<p>I cannot clearly say how I had entered<br>
  the wood; I was so full of sleep just at<br>
  the point where I abandoned the true path.</p>

 <p>But when I’d reached the bottom of a hill —<br>
  it rose along the boundary of the valley<br>
  that had harassed my heart with so much fear —</p>

<p>I looked on high and saw its shoulders clothed<br>
  already by the rays of that same planet<br>
  which serves to lead men straight along all roads.</p>

<p>At this my fear was somewhat quieted;<br>
  for through the night of sorrow I had spent,<br>
  the lake within my heart felt terror present.</p>

<p>And just as he who, with exhausted breath,<br>
  having escaped from sea to shore, turns back<br>
  to watch the dangerous waters he has quit,</p>

<p>so did my spirit, still a fugitive,<br>
  turn back to look intently at the pass<br>
  that never has let any man survive.</p>

<p>I let my tired body rest awhile.<br>
  Moving again, I tried the lonely slope —<br>
  my firm foot always was the one below.</p>

<p>And almost where the hillside starts to rise —<br>
  look there! — a leopard, very quick and lithe,<br>
  a leopard covered with a spotted hide.</p>

<p>He did not disappear from sight, but stayed;<br>
  indeed, he so impeded my ascent<br>
  that I had often to turn back again.</p>

<p>The time was the beginning of the morning;<br>
  the sun was rising now in fellowship<br>
  with the same stars that had escorted it</p>

<p>when Divine Love first moved those things of beauty;<br>
  so that the hour and the gentle season<br>
  gave me good cause for hopefulness on seeing</p>

<p>  that beast before me with his speckled skin;<br>
  but hope was hardly able to prevent<br>
  the fear I felt when I beheld a lion.</p>

<p>  His head held high and ravenous with hunger —<br>
  even the air around him seemed to shudder —<br>
  this lion seemed to make his way against me.</p>

<p>  And then a she-wolf showed herself; she seemed<br>
  to carry every craving in her leanness;<br>
  she had already brought despair to many.</p>

<p>  The very sight of her so weighted me<br>
  with fearfulness that I abandoned hope<br>
  of ever climbing up that mountain slope.</p>

<p>  Even as he who glories while he gains<br>
  will, when the time has come to tally loss,<br>
  lament with every thought and turn despondent,</p>

<p>  so was I when I faced that restless beast<br>
  which, even as she stalked me, step by step<br>
  had thrust me back to where the sun is speechless.</p>

<p>  While I retreated down to lower ground,<br>
  before my eyes there suddenly appeared<br>
  one who seemed faint because of the long silence.</p>

<p>  When I saw him in that vast wilderness,<br>
  “Have pity on me,” were the words I cried,<br>
  “whatever you may be — a shade, a man.”</p>

<p>  He answered me: “Not man; I once was man.<br>
  Both of my parents came from Lombardy,<br>
  and both claimed Mantua as native city.</p>

<p>  And I was born, though late, sub Julio,<br>
  and lived in Rome under the good Augustus —<br>
  the season of the false and lying gods.</p>

<p>  I was a poet, and I sang the righteous<br>
  son of Anchises who had come from Troy<br>
  when flames destroyed the pride of Ilium.</p>

<p>  But why do you return to wretchedness?<br>
  Why not climb up the mountain of delight,<br>
  the origin and cause of every joy?”</p>

<p>  “And are you then that Virgil, you the fountain<br>
  that freely pours so rich a stream of speech?”<br>
  I answered him with shame upon my brow.</p>

<p>  “O light and honor of all other poets,<br>
  may my long study and the intense love<br>
  that made me search your volume serve me now.</p>

<p>  You are my master and my author, you —<br>
  the only one from whom my writing drew<br>
  the noble style for which I have been honored.</p>

<p>  You see the beast that made me turn aside;<br>
  help me, o famous sage, to stand against her,<br>
  for she has made my blood and pulses shudder,”</p>

<p>  “It is another path that you must take,”<br>
  he answered when he saw my tearfulness,<br>
  “if you would leave this savage wilderness;</p>

<p>  the beast that is the cause of your outcry<br>
  allows no man to pass along her track,<br>
  but blocks him even to the point of death;</p>

<p>  her nature is so squalid, so malicious<br>
  that she can never sate her greedy will;<br>
  when she has fed, she’s hungrier than ever.</p>

<p>  She mates with many living souls and shall<br>
  yet mate with many more, until the Greyhound<br>
  arrives, inflicting painful death on her.</p>

<p>  That Hound will never feed on land or pewter,<br>
  but find his fare in wisdom, love, and virtue;<br>
  his place of birth shall be between two felts.</p>

<p>  He will restore low-lying Italy for which<br>
  the maid Camilla died of wounds,<br>
  and Nisus, Turnus, and Euryalus.</p>

<p>  And he will hunt that beast through every city<br>
  until he thrusts her back again to Hell,<br>
  for which she was first sent above by envy.</p>

<p>  Therefore, I think and judge it best for you<br>
  to follow me, and I shall guide you, taking<br>
  you from this place through an eternal place,</p>

<p>  where you shall hear the howls of desperation<br>
  and see the ancient spirits in their pain,<br>
  as each of them laments his second death;</p>

<p>  and you shall see those souls who are content<br>
  within the fire, for they hope to reach —<br>
  whenever that may be — the blessed people.</p>

<p>  If you would then ascend as high as these,<br>
  a soul more worthy than I am will guide you;<br>
  I’ll leave you in her care when I depart,</p>

<p>  because that Emperor who reigns above,<br>
  since I have been rebellious to His law,<br>
  will not allow me entry to His city.</p>

<p>  He governs everywhere, but rules from there;<br>
  there is His city, His high capital:<br>
  o happy those He chooses to be there!”</p>

<p>  And I replied: “O poet — by that God<br>
  whom you had never come to know — I beg you,<br>
  that I may flee this evil and worse evils,</p>

<p>  to lead me to the place of which you spoke,<br>
  that I may see the gateway of Saint Peter<br>
  and those whom you describe as sorrowful.”</p>

<p>  Then he set out, and I moved on behind him.</p>
